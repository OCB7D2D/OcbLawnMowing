# Lawn Mowing Mod - 7 Days to Die (A20) Addon

What started as a small Proof of concept has grown into a feature rich
Mod, that should satisfy a few of your farming sim desires. I've added
a few treats here and there to make it a better overall experience.

Needs to be installed client and server side. And both need EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) to be
turned off! There is no server-side only version of this mod as it contains custom code.

Currently there is only the Ride-On Lawn Tractor Model from Zilox.
There might be more in the distant future, like a manual lawn mower.

Special Thanks to all the people that made this mod possible!

## Lawn Tractor

The required parts for the placeable vehicle are unlocked at Vehicle Crafting
Skill Level 15. In its base configuration, it can only remove grass and bushes,
but doesn't collect any items. You will need modifiers for advanced tasks.

### Toggling Lawn Tractor Features

In order to enable the mowing/harvesting, you have to press F. The function will toggle
alternating with the light, so to only toggle mowing/harvesting, press it twice.

## Vehicle Modifiers

The Lawn Tractor has various modifiers to upgrade its capabilities.

### Grass Collector

![Grass Collector Recipe](Screens/recipe-grass-collector.png)

This is the simplest modifier that you should be able to get quite early.
It will only collect items from grass and bushes, and the yield will be
significantly lower than when harvesting by hand/tool. You can get a fully
functional grass collector from harvesting pristine lawn tractors. Otherwise
you can find or buy the schematics, or unlock Living Off the Land Level 1.

### Plant Collector

![Plant Collector Recipe](Screens/recipe-plant-collector.png)

With this modifier you will also harvest and collect items from various other
small plants, like cotton, coffee or mushrooms. Yield is also significantly
lower than when harvested by hand/tool. You can get a fully functional plant
collector from harvesting pristine lawn tractors. Otherwise you can find or
buy the schematics, or unlock Living Off the Land Level 2.

### Crop Harvester

![Crop Harvester Recipe](Screens/recipe-crop-harvester.png)

Upgrade for the plant collector, that gives much better yield, a bit less when
harvested by hand/tool though. It should be able to collect every growing crop
and also gives seeds back. You can get a fully functional plant collector from
harvesting pristine lawn tractors. Otherwise you can find or buy the schematics,
or unlock Living Off the Land Level 3.

### Crop Protector

![Crop Protector Recipe](Screens/recipe-crop-protector.png)

Basic mod that protects all player plants, so you don't have to worry that
you accidentally mow down your own plants when tiding up the surroundings.
You can get a fully functional plant collector from harvesting pristine
lawn tractors. Otherwise you can find or buy the schematics, or unlock
Advanced Engineering Level 2.

### Crop Reseeder

![Crop Reseeder Recipe](Screens/recipe-crop-reseeder.png)

Upgrade for the crop protector, that will automatically reseed player plants
when harvesting. Seeds must be filled into the vehicle inventory, as you will
not get enough seeds back from harvesting mostly. Speed for harvesting and
reseeding has been limited to make it a bit more realistic and to make it
not too overpowered.

### Harvestable Prefabs

![Harvestable Lawn Tractors](Screens/harvestable-vehicles.jpg)

There are 3 different damage level variations of the Lawn Tractor, which all
come in 7 different colors, so 21 new randomly placed vehicles in the world.
They can all be harvested for parts and give the same resources as regular
cars, plus a few additional items. Pristine Lawn Tractors have a good chance
to drop either a fully functional modifier part or one of the other rare
resources you need to build the recipes. A damaged Lawn Tractor sill has
a small chance to give you a rare resource for the recipes, while a wrecked
vehicle will only give the usual scrap that cars would give you.
